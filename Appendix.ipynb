    "\n",
    "The dataset `Coffee_sales.csv` consists of **3,547 transactional records** with columns such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `money`: revenue per transaction (numeric, continuous)  \n",
    "- `hour_of_day`: 24-hour timestamp of purchase  \n",
    "- `Weekday`: day of week (categorical)  \n",
    "- `coffee_name`: product purchased  \n",
    "- `Time_of_Day`: derived categorical variable  \n",
    "- `Weekdaysort`: numeric column for weekday sorting  \n",

    "The dataset contained no missing values in the key variables used for analysis.  \n",
    "Currency values were formatted as floats, rounded for readability in visualization.  \n",
    "Outliers (very high single-transaction amounts) were retained since they likely correspond to bulk orders operationally relevant for sales volume planning.\n"

    "### 4.1 Normalization and Staffing Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A normalization and ceiling function was applied to translate sales intensity into a **recommended staffing level per hour**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "hour_sales = sales_by_hour.set_index(\"hour_of_day\")[\"money\"]\n",

    "recommended_staff = (normalized * 5).apply(math.ceil) + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variable `hour_sales` gives absolute sales by hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dividing by `hour_sales.max()` scales all values between 0–1 (min–max normalization).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiplying by 5 scales the range to 0–5, roughly reflecting relative labor intensity for a small café (where 5 employees represent peak coverage).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applying `math.ceil()` ensures discrete staff counts (no fractions).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding +1 ensures a minimum staffing baseline even during off-peak hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "This heuristic-based transformation mirrors real-world scheduling logic: sales intensity correlates with labor need, but always requires minimum coverage for operations and safety."
