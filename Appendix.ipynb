    "- `money`: revenue per transaction (numeric, continuous)  \n",

    "### Explanation of the Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The staffing calculation proceeds in five key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`hour_sales`** — represents total hourly revenue, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "   | hour_of_day | money ($) |\n",
    "   |--------------|-----------|\n",
    "   | 6 | 120 |\n",
    "   | 7 | 250 |\n",
    "   | 8 | 430 |\n",
    "   | 9 | 670 |\n",
    "   | 10 | 620 |\n",
    "   | 11 | 540 |\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, 9–10 AM is clearly the high-demand period.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalization:**  \n",
    "   Dividing by `hour_sales.max()` scales all hourly sales to a 0–1 range:  \n",
    "   $[\n",
    "   \\text{normalized}_i = \\frac{\\text{sales}_i}{\\text{max(sales)}}\n",
    "   ]$  \n",
    "   For example, if 9 AM = \\$670 and 6 AM = \\$120, then:\n",
    "   $[\n",
    "   \\text{normalized}(6 \\text{AM}) = 120 / 670 ≈ 0.18\n",
    "   ]$\n",
    "   This allows comparison of relative sales intensity across hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scaling:**  \n",
    "   Multiplying by 5 maps the normalized sales into a theoretical range of 0–5.  \n",
    "   This constant (5) represents the **maximum number of employees needed during peak demand** for a small- to mid-sized coffee shop.  \n",
    "   It’s a tunable parameter that can be adapted for larger stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ceiling Function (`math.ceil()`):**  \n",
    "   Rounds each scaled value **up** to the nearest integer, ensuring that fractional workloads are represented by whole staff members.  \n",
    "   For example:\n",
    "   - 9 AM (normalized 1.00 × 5 = 5.00 → ceil = 5)\n",
    "   - 6 AM (normalized 0.18 × 5 = 0.9 → ceil = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Baseline Adjustment (+1):**  \n",
    "   Adds a **minimum coverage of one staff member**, ensuring that even during very low traffic hours (late evenings or early mornings), at least one barista is on duty for safety and customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final function therefore transforms revenue into operationally interpretable staff counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[\n",
    "\\text{Recommended Staff}_i = \\lceil (\\text{Sales}_i / \\text{Max Sales}) \\times 5 \\rceil + 1\n",
    "]$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **nonlinear heuristic**, meaning small increases in sales at lower hours may not proportionally increase staffing, but high-volume hours rapidly reach peak staffing levels.\n"

    "\n",
    "Hence, the model recommends **6 staff members at peak (9 AM)** and **2–3 during slower hours (6 AM, 8 PM)** consistent with observed transaction volume patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization:** Enables comparison across stores and days by removing scale bias.  \n",
    "- **Scaling factor (×5):** Reflects realistic peak staffing capacity; can be recalibrated for store size or regional norms.  \n",
    "- **Ceiling and baseline adjustment:** Prevents fractional staffing and ensures continuous coverage.  \n",
    "- **Interpretability:** The resulting staffing chart aligns visually with transaction and revenue peaks, making it actionable for operations teams.\n",

    "This transformation is **not a predictive model**, but an **empirical operational heuristic** derived from proportional scaling ideal for translating historical demand patterns into scheduling decisions without requiring regression-based forecasting.\n"
