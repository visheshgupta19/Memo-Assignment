Role: Coffee Franchise Owner / Investor

Background

- Time: High time pressure as they typically glance at executive summaries or snapshots of performance and not detailed datasets.

- Domain Knowledge: They have a good grasp of business principles such as profit margins, operating costs, and market performance. Their understanding of coffee-specific operations such as daily sales cycles or product-level trends, however, could be intermediate because they rely on store managers for that.

- Technical Knowledge: They are not familiar with data beyond high-level performance measurements and simple visualizations such as bar charts or month-to-month comparisons. They like simple and plain interpretations compared to technical or statistical.
