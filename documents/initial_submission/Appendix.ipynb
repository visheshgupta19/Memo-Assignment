    "\n",
    "#### **Aggregation by Shift Block**\n",
    "Summing hourly revenue within the three shift ranges smooths local fluctuations and aligns the analysis with how managers actually schedule staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Normalization**\n",
    "Each shift’s sales are divided by the maximum shift total to scale values from 0–1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{normalized}_i = \\frac{\\text{sales}_i}{\\max(\\text{sales})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expresses demand as a **relative intensity measure**, independent of absolute sales levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scaling and Conversion to Staff Counts**\n",
    "Multiplying normalized intensity by 3 translates workload into a practical staffing range (up to **3 incremental workers above baseline**).  \n",
    "Rounding and adding +1 guarantees a minimum coverage of one barista even in low-traffic periods:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Operational Interpretation**\n",
    "- **Morning (4 staff):** High early demand from commuters → max coverage for speed and prep.  \n",
    "- **Midday (3 staff):** Moderate traffic → lean crew focused on restock and cleanup.  \n",
    "- **Evening (4 staff):** Renewed demand → scale back up for social and after-work orders.\n",
